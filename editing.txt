Chris:	Will we have a minute in today’s session where you could quickly show us how to use the generative AI prompts to help with our Contrast Frames? I must be doing something wrong (that’s my gap).
Cory Riley:	what's your favorite techniques for  1) capturing follow-ups that need their participation to create alignment  (recapping the issues/pain points at hand to create ownership...) 2) decision making models to get people agreeing on the problem to solve, and approaches.
Roshni Thakkar:	Reacted to "Will we have a minut..." with 💯
Cory Riley:	"a confused mind doesn't buy" confused meetings don't get consensus tips on getting people into a brainstorming  / aligning mindset creating shared ownership - the students, the staff experience
Heather DeWaal:	I’ve found success in settings like that saying things like, “I’m only interested in reviewing what happened in terms of how it can help us move forward and keep this from reoccurring.” Then be prepared with the details about what you learned and how it’s going to move you forward.

Cory Riley:	ppl have different understandings, different models from previous lives,    and want to use their tool/method to solve it we need to present our own framework that's simple yet powerful. based on a change mgmt process that is an evolution / ecosystem mindset that needs strategic milestones (a capability maturity model),

Kathryn Dean:	Replying to "question:   is it us..." I think it depends on where they are in the journey. If the decision has already been made to proceed, no real need to talk a lot about the old way.
Cory Riley:	Reacted to "That aligns with wha..." with 👍
mike.iampietro:	Does the prioritization  question assume that the change can be made independent of one another?
Cory Riley:	people can sometimes think, "the old thing is ok" if you start with that. if you start with a vision and goal, a value they believe in, then the current way can be more easily seen as an obstacle. ie; "the cost of not doing this."
